		PRESERVING THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER

	The Internet as we know it today, is a collection of technological acheivements from all over the world. It is a scientific masterpice, recording our thoughts, imaginations, and maybe even our very essence. It has beome part of us, we seek it each and every time we have a question or any kind of thirst for knowledge. In a way, it has become the choice for Intellectual Augmentation for any who is willing to learn it's devices. It may have many names, but the one most important aspect is the simulated space in which it provides. Cyberspace we call it, a non existing place where ideas can be traded at the speed of light, duplicated and replicated at virtually no cost. Paul Day, in "Cyber Attack" defines this as: "cyberspace is not a foreign country or a mythical land. Cyberspace is a human construct that is infinitely malleable by both operators and skilled hackers." Until recently, Cyberspace was relatively safe, filled with electronic communication geeks, and hobbyists, with virtually no major consequences for anything traded or abused. It was not until recently that Cyberspace has become almost completely interconnected with the outside world. Because of this, because of the powers that it could possibly posess to manipulate the real world, there are those out to profit on it's ability, willing to destroy Cyberspace with Cyber-Warfare, unless we do something to stop it.

	Cyberspace has not always been an important medium in our dialy lives. It does not just consist of facebook, twitter, and all the "lolcat" pages that so many obsess over, it is the space in which government organizations communicate with one another through. It is the space in which NASA delivers it's data through, reaching out into the stars. It is a web, that now not only encompasses the planet earth, but now expands past our moon, and in some ways, can be considered to have passed even pluto delivering data to the people of earth from the space probe, Voyager. The beginnings of cyberspace was filled with hobbyists, students, and hackers. The importance of Cyberspace was mostly within the social and intellectual pursuits of their users. There was no important banking, or tax filing, it did not contain the actual identities of their users, and if it were shut down tomorrow those of that time would hardly skip a beatin normal life. Today this is much different, if our ability to access our lives within Cyberspace, was suddenly interrupted, many of us would not be able to practice our employment duties, and our basic forms of communication with our family and friends would vanish.

	Cyberspace has a flaw, it was never intended to be one of the main drivers for commerce in our society, and the computers which run it, cannot descipher between malicious and safe code during operation. Because of this, it lacks in security allowing certain malicious powers to manipulate it's functionality. In it's greatest consequence, this requires developers all over the world to reinvent the wheel in a more secure way, whenever a security flaw is found.In fact, the original Network most closely related to our Internet of today, was ARPANET, produced by the government to allow communications across the country even within a nuclear event. Despite it's percieved indestructability, the elements of cyber crime, and cyber warfare could potentially destroy Cyberspace as we know it.

	The greatest of all threats to Cyberspace is Cyber War. Cyber war between governments can result in any Internet connected device being destroyed. An example of this was recently discovered that it was the Stuxnet worm in which destroyed the Iranian nuclear facility, by deactivating all of the safety features within the plant. Until recently, it was not known if a cyber attack could actually destroy a facility of hardware.

	Cyber war is a war of intelligence. There is no way to actually know for sure who is the true attacker when plausible denyability is involved. Any computer can be hijacked to commit a crime, there is no way to actually link an individual or entity to a malicious attack. Therefore, Cyber War is a war of intelligence, in a battle field filled with relativity.
